
GPIO DMA Example Project

This project demonstrates the functionality of having the
DMA perform a memory to GPIO (peripheral) transfer 
independent of the CPU.

When started, the CPU will prepare an area of memory with
some known contents. A DMA request channel is tied together 
with TIMER0's output to perform a DMA transfer to the LEDs
(P2.6 - P2.2) every second while the CPU is toggling the 
LED P1.28.

If INT0 (P2.10) is pressed, the uC will go into "Sleep" mode.
